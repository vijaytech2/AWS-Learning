AWS cloud, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform that provides a vast array of IT services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Instead of buying and maintaining their own physical servers and data centers, businesses and individuals can "rent" these computing resources like storage, databases, and processing power from Amazon, enabling them to move faster and lower IT costs. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that include database options, networking, mobile development, and security.
